 * we now depend on libdaemon
 + pidfile implemented
 * logging macros (dbg, err, inf, wrn) now use daemonlog
 * macro scp(d, s) replaced by d = strdup(s)
 + add option -k, --kill to kill the running hcrond
 + SIGHUP, SIGINT and SIGQUIT handled correctly
 	INT & QUIT update the db and die
	HUP update the db and start anew, remembering jobs_running
 * removed locking as none needed
 * no need for garbage list, removed
 * job list is now just a single linked list (should become a tree one day)
 * thanks in README
 * trans now handles NULL inputs (only the 3rd param can be NULL)
 * split database refresh stuff
 * signals are handled by libdaemon, in run_jobs and main
 	libdaemon provides daemon_signal_next
	run_jobs handles SIGALRM and SIGCHLD, other signals mean return
	main handles SIGHUP and dies on SIGINT and SIGQUIT
